<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
<p>I think the most ridiculous rule is that we can't wear whatever socks we want with our man pants.
  <h2> Reasons</h2>
  <p>When wearing our man pants you don't usually see someone's socks because their pants cover it. I don't understand why it matters what color or patterned socks we wear, they don't affect our uniform and you can't see them anyway.
