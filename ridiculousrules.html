<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
<p><b>I<b>think the most ridiculous rule is that we can't wear whatever socks we want with our man pants.  <h2> Reasons</h2>
<p><b>When wearing our man pants<b> no one can usually see your socks because pants tend to be long enough to cover them. So having a rule about only being allowed to wear a certain type of sock is ridiculous to me because I think as long as your pants cover your pink, polkadot, fuzzy, superhero, or christmas socks we should be allowed to wear them.
